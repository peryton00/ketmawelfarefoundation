After a decade of foundational environmental work, the organization was formally revived, restructured, and re-registered in 2025 under the visionary leadership of President Mr. Ankit Soni, a Mining Engineer with deep expertise in remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental science.",
      "What makes Ketma different is not just its mission — it's the investment behind it. Before ever seeking a single rupee of external funding, the founding team invested over ₹70 Lakhs of personal capital into land restoration, lemongrass cultivation, distillation infrastructure, and community training. This is not a proposal-driven NGO — this is a results-first institution that has already built the proof of concept with its own hands and resources.",
      "Today, Ketma operates across 10 formally registered domains — from environmental conservation and organic agriculture to women's empowerment, tribal welfare, public health, education, disaster management, and CSR facilitation. Its integrated model treats ecology, livelihood, and community dignity as inseparable — because they are."

    "body": [
      "Ketma Welfare Foundation, a restructured and revitalized non-profit organization based in Ambikapur, Surguja district, Chhattisgarh, today announced its formal re-emergence as one of the region's most comprehensive grassroots institutions for environmental restoration, tribal empowerment, and sustainable development.",
      "Originally established in 2012 as Ketma Paryavaran Sanrakshan Samiti, the organization has undergone a complete structural transformation in 2025 under the leadership of President Mr. Ankit Soni — a Mining Engineer with expertise in remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental science. The organization's scope has been expanded to cover 10 formally registered domains, and its Darpan registration (ID: CG/2025/0801889) marks its entry into the national ecosystem of recognized development organizations.",
      "The Foundation's flagship initiative — 'Green Land, Green Futures' — has already achieved remarkable milestones: 110 acres of barren, eroded land transformed through scientific soil analysis (RUSLE model) and lemongrass cultivation, with 24.2 lakh slips planted. The team has established Surguja district's first organic essential oil distillation unit, created a complete farm-to-bottle production chain, and developed a diversified product line including essential oils, room fresheners, incense sticks, organic soaps, and herbal teas.",
      "What distinguishes Ketma from conventional NGOs is its investment model — the founding team has invested over ₹70 Lakhs of personal capital into infrastructure, cultivation, and community training before seeking any external funding. This results-first approach has built genuine community trust and created a replicable model for other regions.",
      "The Foundation now seeks strategic CSR partnerships, government collaboration, and community support to scale its proven model across Chhattisgarh and beyond."
